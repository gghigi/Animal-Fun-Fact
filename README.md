### Story

In this project, we’ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

Our program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not. Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.


## Getting Started

Create a folder in your terminal `mkdir` and `git clone` the repo to your local machine by using the HTTPS link on the code green button. Navigate with the command `cd` to the folder and open in your IDE with `code .`. Change the HTML tesxt, play with the CSS styles or change the way it looks on different screens by targeting the media queries and then `git add .` and then `git commit -m "Add your message"` to save it to your repo and the `git push` to send it up on GitHub. 

You cannot sell, license, lease or do anything else with the code from Codecademy under their copyright.

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed a terminal like Ubuntu to write on the command line, an integrated devlopment environment like Visual Studio Code to access the files and work on them. Scripts are already in the file to access other resources, but you can add your own.


### Installing

Install the programs and follow the Getting Started for a guide on how to use the repository.

## Deployment

To deploy this site on a live website go to insights on your repo and scroll to select GitHub pages, select the main branch and save. After few hours you should be able to use the link to see your website live. You can always check how it looks from your terminal using `open index.html` and it will open a page in your browser to see the website on a local server.
